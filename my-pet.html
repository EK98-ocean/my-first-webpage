    <h1>My Pets</h1>
    <h2>Bumi</h2>
    <p>Although I don't own any pets at the moment, I plan on making a home for a few animals when I have the capacity to do so. This page is about my aspirational pets.</p>
    <ol>I would like to get the following:
      <li>A kitten (in any colour but preferably grey).</li>
      <li>A daschund puppy</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>We'll have loads of fun doing our activities, including:
      <li>Going to the beach.</li>
      <li>Going on long walks.</li>
      <li>Cycling, with them in my bicycle's basket.</li>
      <li>Napping together</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's important that I get them at the same time and both while young, so that they can grow up together.
      While daschunds are typically quite tolerant of cats, they can be quite territorial when they get older.
      Also, it would best to get a female cat, as they get on better with dogs in general. She would, unfortunately,
      have to be spayed, otherwise we'd have new kittens every few months!</p>
